**Welcome to Carbonable Protocol!**

We are a team of developers and researchers working on creating an open-source smart contract library for promoting sustainable development and ReFi protocols. Our goal is to provide a reusable and flexible solution for blockchain-based sustainable development and ReFi protocols, making it easy for developers to create secure and efficient systems.

Our Carbonable Protocol library is designed to be modular and easy to integrate into existing protocols. It includes a variety of features that enable developers to perform complex mathematical operations, implement carbon offsetting and taxation, and create a transparent and decentralized marketplace for carbon credits.

We believe in transparency and open-source development, that's why our code is available on our Github repository. Our protocol is built on the Ethereum blockchain and is fully auditable.

Our team is committed to creating a more sustainable future by promoting sustainable development and ReFi protocols. We are always looking for ways to improve our protocol and welcome contributions from the community. If you're interested in contributing or have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us.
